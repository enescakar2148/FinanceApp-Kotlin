# FinanceApp-Kotlin
In this project, an income-expense tracking application is being developed.

## There are 3 branches in the project
1. main
2. beta
3. dev

### MAIN Branch
The Main branch is the branch with the most stable code and version available. 
**_PLEASE DO NOT SEND PUSH REQUESTS TO THIS BRANCH! We gotta keep this place clean_**

### BETA Branch
The Beta branch is the branch where newly written features are added piece by piece. The included features are not fully completed. Let's take auth transactions as an example. The content here may contain a crafted UI code. BUT it may not be connected to a server and cannot be integrated into any backend.
In summary, it is the branch where small tests are made and new updates are added. 
**_PLEASE DO NOT SEND PUSH REQUESTS TO THIS BRANCH! The pull requests you send to the dev branch will be merged with this branch after they are reviewed. You MUST open a pull request on the dev branch and make your improvements/contributions to the dev branch._**

### DEV Branch
It contains the freshest and newest codes in the dev branch. As a result of the fresh and new codes it contains, the error rate is very high. The codes written in it may not be complete. Branch used for development
